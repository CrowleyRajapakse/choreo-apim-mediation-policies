# Package Overview

This package contains the mediation policy "Log Message" available out of the box in Choreo. This policy provides the capability to 
log the payload of a request/response flowing through an HTTP proxy created in Choreo. 

## Usage

This will be available to select when attaching mediation policies to a proxy in Choreo. Attaching this policy multiple times while not restricted, will 
only result in duplicate log entries for the same request/response.
